I was not good at CSS at that point, so non of these websites are mobile friendly. But it's proved that most things I learnt are useful for my later projects in the same year (
- https://github.com/KrisCris/MHRise-Charm-Generator
- https://github.com/KrisCris/ConvexHull-ChansAlgorithm

), especially the Vue.js Framework, which is a real life saver. If you are comfortable of self-teaching for most of the time and learning new stuffs, then go ahead take this course.
