Normally you cannot check the my_files.php by copy and paste its link to the html valodator as I wrote redirection code in php forbidding un-logined access.

For the test, I made an exception - manually set `$_SESSION["username"]="testuser"`, that's why i can test it in the validator.

For you convience, result are in these images, you don't need to manually test the html again, because you can't.
